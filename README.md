# Description

This project contains a code for a simple social app made in React. Within the app you can feed its users' posts, add your own, like or dislike them, follow or unfollow the users. Moreover you can sign a new user up and perform sample users log in.

## Underlying API

The app makes requests to an API prepared, maintained and shared by [Akademia 108](https://akademia108.pl/). KUDOS for them for it.

Its URL is: [https://akademia108.pl/api/social-app/](https://akademia108.pl/api/social-app/).

Note that the API only mock signing new users up.

## User login

If you want to check a user login functionality use only following **username**: \
*adam*, *tomek* or *mietek*, \
all with the same **password**: \
*1234*. \
This limitation results from the mock user signup mentioned above.

## Usage

This is rather self-explanatory. Just login and check all functionalities up.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

### **TBA**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.

# Miscellaneous

## Create React App usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This means built-in **jest**, **webpack** and **babel** installations (see ```node_modules``` folder).
